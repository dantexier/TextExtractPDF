Agricultural water management provides the basic support and guarantee for targeted poverty alleviation. *is paper presents a 3E + 1 evaluation model for the performance of agricultural water management in targeted poverty alleviation based on 3E theory, which is more scientiﬁc, reasonable, and reliable. On this basis, an evaluation index system including three levels of indicators is designed, and the weight of each evaluation index and performance evaluation model is determined. A case study of a county in the old district of Maoshan in Jiangsu province was conducted using the proposed evaluation theory and methods. *e results show that the overall performance of agricultural water management for targeted poverty alleviation in this area was good but needs more improvement in innovation. *e evaluation results are roughly consistent with the evaluations of higher authorities, experts, and scholars, which proves that the evaluation system is scientiﬁc and reasonable. 
1. Introduction 
In the process of targeted poverty alleviation, agricultural water management is essential and indispensable for ensuring rural water safety, improving rural water environment, en- hancing agricultural comprehensive productivity, and im- proving farmers’ production and living standards [1]. It is crucial for winning the tough battle against poverty. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, targeted poverty alleviation work has been guided by Xi Jinping’s thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era. China has been deepening the implementation of the water management policy of “prioritizing water conser- vation, balanced space, and systemic governance.” Adhering to the basic strategy of targeted poverty alleviation and poverty reduction, the Chinese government has put an emphasis on severely impoverished areas and optimized the supply policy by promoting the construction and management of agricul- tural water conservancy in poor areas. By solidly promoting industry poverty alleviation, designated poverty alleviation, counterpart support, and “ﬁve in one” water conservancy poverty alleviation work in the old rural areas, China has been 
working to win the battle against poverty and build a mod- erately prosperous society in all respects [2]. 
Despite the great achievements in agricultural water management for targeted poverty alleviation, the work needs to be scientiﬁcally and eﬀectively evaluated. In this way, problems can be identiﬁed through evaluation, thus pro- viding a basis for poverty alleviation policy making in the post-poverty alleviation era. For this purpose, it is necessary to design a scientiﬁc and reasonable performance evaluation system through quantitative methods. By digging into the problems of agricultural water management for targeted poverty alleviation, the evaluation system can promote the high-quality development of the work and help to establish a long-term agricultural water management mechanism for targeted poverty alleviation in the post-poverty alleviation era. *is has become a key scientiﬁc frontier issue that needs to be systematically studied and thoroughly discussed.

Alleviation Based on 3E Model. *e 3E theory (economy, eﬃciency, eﬀectiveness) proposed by Professor Checkland (Checkland, PB) based on SSM (soft system methodology) from a system perspective has been regarded as the basic model for public policy evaluation and has become the basis for various late-stage policy evaluations. SSM is a meth- odology for recognizing and handling complex problems because when soft factors such as politics, society, culture, and human behaviors are mixed into the system, traditional hard system analysis (e.g., modeling proﬁt maximization) often loses its advantages and sometimes fails [3]. 
*e object of performance evaluation is a poverty alle- viation method that implements accurate identiﬁcation, targeted assistance, and management [4], and the evaluation content is the quality and eﬀect of agricultural water management according to targeted poverty alleviation policy [5]. In building a performance evaluation system, it is critically important to decide how to eﬀectively measure whether the allocation and management of resources is reasonable and whether poverty alleviation initiatives are eﬀective as well as the quality of poverty alleviation, outcome satisfaction, and sustainability of targeted poverty alleviation policies [6]. 
A performance evaluation framework based on 3E theory can ensure the scientiﬁc validity of the performance evaluation of agricultural water targeted poverty alleviation. *erefore, according to the basic paradigm of policy eval- uation, this paper details the performance evaluation process into ﬁve stages: policy formulation and goal setting, targeted poverty alleviation input, alleviation process, alleviation output, and alleviation outcome, which fully integrates 3E theory into the whole process to extract the evaluation di- mension [7]. *roughout the performance evaluation, tar- getedness is stressed and is also the essential diﬀerence between targeted poverty alleviation and wide-reaching poverty alleviation. *erefore, targetedness needs to be fully reﬂected in each dimension of the evaluation model [8]. In addition, this paper innovatively incorporates the sustain- ability of agricultural water management in targeted poverty alleviation into the targeted poverty alleviation evaluation system [9]. *is can eﬀectively reﬂect the sustainability and stability of agricultural water management in targeted poverty alleviation, forming a 3E + 1 evaluation model (as shown in Figure 1). 
2.2. Construction of the Index System for Agricultural Water Management in Targeted Poverty Alleviation. *e con- struction of the performance evaluation index system is a multiobjective and multilevel complex systematic engi- neering, which should follow the principles of compre- hensiveness, scientiﬁcity, comparability, operability, and sustainability [10]. *e performance evaluation indicators should reﬂect not only the main contents of the assessment of eﬀectiveness but also the targetedness, stability, and quality of the targeted poverty alleviation work so that the overall evaluation function of the indicator system is greater than the simple accumulation of indicators. It is necessary to build a clear and reasonable hierarchical systematic structure

[11] and avoid overlapping between the indicators while retaining mutual connections [12]. *e evaluation indicators established should be universally applicable and feasible [13] and comparable and dynamic for comparisons between diﬀerent regions, time, and space [14]. Evaluation indicators need to be feasible so the data to be used should be drawn from existing data sources and be veriﬁable [15]; mutual inclusion and implicit relationship should be avoided; work involved in the evaluation system should also be long-term and continuous [16]. Based on the goals, characteristics, and related literature research of agricultural water management in targeted poverty alleviation [17], the indicator system is designed as Table 1. 
2.3. Weight Determination of the Performance Evaluation Index System for Agricultural Water Management in Targeted Poverty Alleviation. *is study adopts analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate and rank the four primary in- dicators of the performance index system for agricultural water management in targeted poverty alleviation, while the average weighting method is used for the secondary and tertiary indicators. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP), ﬁrst proposed by Professor Saaty in the 1970s, is a structured decision-making method that combines qualitative and quantitative analyses and is applicable to the analysis of multiple indicator systems [18]. 
2.3.1. Construct a Judgment Matrix Based on the Existing Evaluation System. First, the indicators at the criterion level in the performance evaluation indicators are analyzed, using an AHP analysis model on a scale from 1 to 9. *e indicators at the criterion level in the performance evaluation indi- cators are compared, and a judgment matrix at the four levels of performance, targetedness, innovation, and sus- tainability is obtained. 
From the statistical results, we can conclude that the relative importance values of sustainability to targetedness, performance, and innovation are 3, 5, and 7, respectively; the relative importance values of targetedness to performance and innovation are 3 and 6, respectively; the relative im- portance value of performance to innovation is 4; the other two relative importance values can be inferred by analogy from the above results. *is leads to the results in Table 2.
