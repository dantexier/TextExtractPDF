Abstract Food banks across the UK are offering basic food supplies and a range of support services to  people who have been affected by years of welfare cuts and the ongoing COVID-19 health crisis.  Despite a growing research interest in the drivers and experiences of food bank use, their own  role in constructing and managing poverty as a social problem has been neglected. Adopting a  Foucauldian  approach,  this  study  critically  explored  how  power  is  exercised  and  subjects  are  formed inside three UK food banks. The localised care for the poor is shown to work through  a pastoral power, which requires confessions of crises and obedience to an expert regime in the  diagnosis and treatment of poverty as an individual condition. By making food aid conditional on  active  engagement  with  other  support  agencies,  volunteers  negotiate  and  translate  neoliberal  discourses of personal responsibility and active citizenship. Findings are linked to a wider critique  of neoliberal government, which works through therapeutic discourses and retains disciplinary  and paternalistic elements in managing poverty at a distance.

Introduction As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 health crisis and its economic impact, it has been  reported that almost a fifth of UK homes with children have experienced hunger during  lockdown (Iqbal, 2020). Food banks under the Trussell Trust (2020a) franchise recorded  an increase of 81% in food bank use compared to the previous year, while the Independent  Food Aid Network (IFAN) saw an increase in need of 177% compared to the previous  year (Goodwin, 2020). Despite calls for more universal welfare provision given the inad- equacies  of  food  aid  (Tarasuk  and  McIntyre,  2020),  food  charities  have  gained  more

visibility as ‘frontline responders’ offering a lifeline to many and have received millions  of pounds in cash and food donations from UK supermarkets (Defra, 2020). The growth  of food banks in the UK is not a new phenomenon (Lambie-Mumford, 2017), and com- mentaries in the media and recent advocacy campaigns by the Trussell Trust and IFAN  (Goodwin, 2019) have attempted to scandalise the need for them in an affluent society.  However,  these  narratives  around  ‘emergency  responses’  imply  that  food  banks  are  needed, in their current form and this moment in history, which places them outside of  power  and  critique  as  natural,  albeit  shameful,  reactions  to  a  retreating  welfare  state.  Taking  a  Foucauldian  approach,  this  study  sought  to  challenge  this  essentialism  by  exploring the active roles food banks take in problematising food poverty and adminis- tering treatments in partnership with other agencies. Analysis of the discursive practices  and power dynamics inside three food banks shows how confessional encounters require  ‘clients’ to perform their worthiness and constitute themselves as active subjects seeking  expert treatment for their individual crisis. Drawing on pastoral power and governmen- tality as an analytic lens, the pastoral care by volunteers is shown to mediate dominant  discourses of welfare conditionality, employability, and discipline, while binding clients  to the authority of an expanding expert regime. Findings are then placed in the context of  pastoral networks and often misunderstood characteristics of neoliberal government to  argue that food banks take an active role in translating neoliberal discourses with subjec- tifying effects in the constitution of poverty as a manageable condition. 
Background The causes of rising food bank use in the UK are now well researched with a wide con- sensus within this literature built around a narrative of welfare retrenchment and state  retreat  following  years  of  austerity  policies  (Caraher  and  Furey,  2018;  Dowler  and  Lambie-Mumford, 2015; Lambie-Mumford, 2018). Loopstra et al. (2018) specifically  highlight the role of benefit sanctions as a key driver for increased food bank use in the  UK to call for the introduction of standardised measurement of food insecurity in national  surveys.  In  addition  to  limitations  in  official  referral  figures  recorded  by  the Trussell  Trust, Garratt (2015) points to the ‘hidden hunger’ in the UK where local food aid is  either unavailable or not accessed for a variety of reasons. Indeed, Loopstra et al. (2019b)  found that 20.7% of UK adults experienced food insecurity in 2016, and a major report  by the Trussell Trust (Sosenko et al., 2019) found that nearly 75% of users had at least  one  health  issue  and  two-thirds  reported  problems  with  the  benefit  system. A  recent  YouGov survey (Loopstra, 2020) has suggested that food insecurity in the UK has quad- rupled as a result of the COVID-19 crisis with over 3 million adults going hungry during  the first 3 weeks of the lockdown. The pandemic has also revealed wider inequalities in  the food system, as well as between providers of food aid in the UK (Power et al., 2020). In their studies of food bank referrals, Perry et al. (2014) found that the predominant  reason for visits was some form of immediate income crisis, caused by either loss of  earnings from employment, change in family circumstances, sudden homelessness, or  benefit problems and sanctions. The authors highlight the positive feedback by clients  praising  ‘the  warmth  of  welcome  they  received  there,  the  opportunity  to  talk,  and  its

signposting to other support services’ (Perry et al., 2014: 12). Haddad et al. (2017: 39)  equally endorse the expansion of advice services where ‘ideally, people should be seeing  advisers before they go to the food bank’. Acknowledging that emergency food aid does  not  address  underlying  causes  but  only  alleviates  symptoms,  Lambie-Mumford  and  Dowler (2014: 1420) equally praise the ‘non-food related support’ as perhaps the ‘pri- mary  contribution  charitable  help  offers’.  To  date,  there  has  been  a  lack  of  critical  engagement with so-called ‘More than Food’ services rolled out by the Trussell Trust in  ‘community  hubs’,  including  cookery  and  budgeting  courses,  ‘jobs’  clubs,  and  other  skills  training.  With  the  exception  of  May  et  al.’s  (2019a)  analysis  of  the  ways  food  banks reproduce scarcity discourses through their rationing practices, there has been a  notable disregard for the power relationships and subjectifying effects of discourse in  these spaces. Indeed, the frequent endorsement of food banks as welcoming spaces of  care (see Cloke et al., 2017; Lambie-Mumford, 2017) tends to idealise an ethics of care  while obscuring the productive features of a pastoral power in guiding the conduct of  both ‘clients’ and volunteers. 
Theoretical background Pastoral power and governmentality The dominant notion of welfare retrenchment driving food bank use in existing research  (Lambie-Mumford, 2018) upholds a strict distinction between state power and private  charities who are merely responding to new gaps left by austerity policies. Addressing  exactly  this  false  dichotomy  between  a  retreating  state  and  non-state  actors,  Lemke  (2007:  45)  outlines  the  critical  potential  of  an  analysis  of  neoliberal  governmentality  where 
political changes are understood not as a decline of state sovereignty but as a promotion of  forms  of  government  that  foster  and  enforce  individual  responsibility,  privatized  risk- management,  empowerment  techniques,  and  the  play  of  market  forces  and  entrepreneurial  models in a variety of social domains. 
The purpose of this study was to explore how governmentality as a style or art of govern- ing  populations  across  practices  and  institutions  (Foucault,  2009a;  Lemke,  2019)  is  translated, negotiated, and realised in these positive terms. For Foucault (2002b), pasto- ral power is above all an individualising form of power based on ancient Christian rituals  through which pastors guide their local ‘flock’ in a combination of institutionalised reli- gious practices, hearing confessions, and guidance towards salvation. While this form of  the Christian pastorate may have largely disappeared, Foucault (2002b, 2009c) remains  adamant that its function has since spread and multiplied across social institutions in the  formation  of  the  modern  state  where  there  can  be  no  understanding  of  contemporary  governmentality without studying the history of individualising strategies and tactics of  pastoral power. Historically, pastoral power has been argued to form the background or  prelude to modern governmentality and the emergence of the Western state founded on  the production of inner truths through subjectification in self-examination and care for

the self where ‘the modern government inherits from the Christian pastorate these indi- vidualising dynamics of dissecting the self, servitude, and a relation to truth within the  self’ (Carrette, 2013: 377). 
As a technology of governing (Oksala, 2013: 328), pastoral power demands complete  obedience and a continuous extraction of personal knowledge in order to normalise sub- jects’ conduct and guide them to well-being as salvation in this world (Foucault, 2002b)  rather than the next. This presents an important paradox where pastoral power is both  ‘distinct’ from political power and its institutions but also mainly concerned with ‘the  worldly order of everyday conduct’ (Carrette, 2013: 381) and always accompanied by a  ‘surveying gaze’ (Siisiäinen, 2015: 234) seeking perfect transparency to illuminate sub- jects’ inner truths and return them to the normality of the flock when necessary. Based on  their research in contemporary health care settings, Waring and Martin (2018: 147) refer  to  these  persistent  disciplinary  elements  as  ‘inspection  practices’,  which  monitor  and  attempt to correct deviating subjectivities in stray sheep. An analysis sensitive to pastoral  power then shifts focus from a hidden yet seemingly all-powerful discursive power of  governmentality onto relational, embodied, and ‘empirically visible agency’ (Martin and  Waring, 2018: 7–8) of situated actors and their involvement in the constitution of subjec- tivities. It emphasises the active role of subjects in translating discourses into identities  and  behaviour  through  local  practices,  which  may  at  times  be  at  odds  with  or  work  against dominant rationalities. 
Avowal and subjectification Foucault’s writings on the history of the Christian pastorate should be read in the context  of his later lectures on the functions of avowal in the justice system. Avowal (Foucault,  2014: 16) here describes ‘a verbal act through which the subject affirms who he is, binds  himself  to  this  truth,  places  himself  in  a  relationship  of  dependence  with  regard  to  another, and modifies at the same time his relationship to himself’. Foucault identifies an  extended growth and ‘accelerations’ of avowals in Western Christian culture where its  central ‘truth-telling function’ (Foucault, 2014: 18) ties the individual to itself and to oth- ers, thereby establishing complex power relationships with new implications for the for- mation  of  the  self.  For  Foucault  (2014:  16),  an  act  of  avowal  is  characterised  and  distinguished from a declaration or statement by voluntary self-constitution as a subject  who then ‘obligates himself [sic] to being what he says he is’ at some personal cost or  difficulty, often shame. Understanding situated confessional dynamics as productive acts  of self-formation then breaks with the essentialism and empiricist profiling of food bank  users in static categories of vulnerability (Loopstra and Lalor, 2017). Since ‘clients’ and  volunteers do not exist prior to discourse or outside of power relations, subjectification  within food bank spaces will be understood as a situated, performative, and non-linear  ‘process of becoming subordinated by power as well as the process of becoming a sub- ject’ (Butler, 1997: 2). Attributing ‘clients’ and volunteers an active role in their subjec- tification through their own truth-telling capacity and relational interactions with others  goes beyond static subject positions as linear outcomes of deterministic discourse (Keller,  2018), contrary to many approaches in governmentality studies.

Methods This  study  was  conducted  between  2016  and  2019  with  the  overall  aim  to  critically  explore the discourses and power relationships at work in British food banks. In contrast  to realist ontologies which may focus on hidden realities of poverty, a critical discursive  approach ‘dismisses the empiricist myth of an easy separation between research object  and  knowledge  production’  (Beetz  and  Schwab,  2018:  347). An  added  sensitivity  for  pastoral power allowed studying ‘how discourses translate into subjectivity, action and  material consequence’ (Martin and Waring, 2018: 8) in local contexts. Although the orig- inal study used a multi-modal approach to analyse a corpus of documents, visual data,  and interviews, this article reports only on interviews conducted in three UK food banks.  After in-depth interviews with two volunteers and the manager at Southern Food Bank1  (SFB), expert interviews were conducted with three senior project managers at Eastern  Food Bank (EFB) and Western Food Bank (WFB) who were much better placed than  volunteers  to  offer  insight  into  policies  and  procedures  across  their  centres.  Whereas  SFB is an independent food bank located in a rural area, EFB and WFB are Trussell Trust  food banks based in large towns with more than a dozen distribution centres and consid- erable  warehouse  capacity.  Semi-structured  interviews  lasted  around  90 minutes  each  and were guided by open questions about daily routines and interactions with clients as  well as partnerships with local agencies. In addition, I kept a reflective diary of observa- tions of interactions and spatial arrangements inside the food banks. 
The study received ethical permission from the Human and Health Sciences School  Research Ethics Panel (SREP) at the University of Huddersfield, and informed consent  was obtained from all participants who were fully briefed about the exploratory nature of  the study. With a broad interest in food bank operations and local partnerships, I used  open questions and some managers later thanked me for giving them a space to pause  and reflect on their practices. I only adopted a more critical but non-normative (Hansen,  2014) perspective during the analysis where it would have been unethical to leave out  data  which  may  show  a  ‘darker’  side  of  food  banks  (Van  Der  Horst  et  al.,  2014). To  address this and ensure transparency and integrity, all reporting is grounded in the par- ticipants’ accounts and aims to show that individual perspectives and experiences are  always shaped by larger discourses and historical constructions of poverty. Ongoing ethi- cal concerns with the complex power dynamics, awareness of my own privileged posi- tion as an outsider, and personal experiences in the food bank meant that I decided not to  interview  ‘clients’  but  to  problematise  these  confessional  encounters  and  promises  of  empowerment. 
All interviews were transcribed, anonymised, and imported into MAXQDA software  (v.12)  for  a  discourse  analysis  guided  by  the  Sociology  of  Knowledge  Approach  to  Discourse (SKAD) and situational analysis (Clarke et al., 2017). SKAD (Keller, 2018)  provides  a  flexible  research  programme  based  on  a  pragmatist  reading  of  Foucault,  which focuses on local practices, socially regulated forms of acting, and how specific  ways of speaking are legitimised in institutional settings. The initial coding identified  dominant problematisations of food poverty, along with intervention strategies, subject  positions of clients, and self-positioning by the managers and volunteers. Problematisations  were a central concern throughout Foucault’s work and can be understood as ways of

framing  a  social  problem  in  need  for  intervention,  and  hence  rendering  it  governable  (Triantafillou,  2012).  In  a  subsequent  round  of  inductive  coding,  different  food  bank  practices were coded to allow easy retrieval for more in-depth discursive analysis through  memos, coding queries, and situational maps for comparisons between sites. 
Findings Pastoral care and the persistence of discipline At all three food banks, volunteers performed their pastoral care for the poor through  packing and distributing food parcels and having personal conversations about the rea- sons for their visit. Located in a rural area, the independent food bank also delivered food  to clients’ homes with the help of local agencies and volunteers occasionally helped with  personal errands. Contents of food parcels varied considerably depending on the availa- bility of donations, and supplies of fresh fruit and vegetables were often held back for  families with children as the embodiment of the ‘worthy poor’ who needed to be cared  for first. In the event of shortages or special dietary requirements, volunteers would go  out and buy suitable items, rather than give out money: 
Like some people say oh why don’t you give people money because you know you’re having  to manage all this food [. . .] umm but then of course you have the problems of giving people  money, you know will they spend it on the right thing is that the fear. (Manager, SFB) 
Faced with the ‘fear’ of clients making the wrong choices, volunteers defended their  pastoral position of authority, deciding over entitlements and making these choices on  behalf of their clients. In addition to the powerful Christian ethos of feeding the hungry,  giving out money would separate pastors from their ‘flock’, diminish their authority, and  expose clients to the temptation of making bad choices. The material design and spatial  divisions inside the food bank enabled many of these paternalistic practices and placed  limits on what clients could say with a strict division between receiving clients as wel- comed  guests  and  giving  volunteers  residing  over  parcel  composition.  While  clients  were seated and questioned by a volunteer, another would go and put their parcel together  in a discursive environment where visible expressions of gratitude are expected (Tarasuk  and Eakin, 2003) and worthiness must constantly be performed. Any ‘fussiness’ over  types, quality, and quantity of food would draw a suspicious pastoral gaze evaluating  their genuine need: 
You would get volunteers that are like well oh they can’t be that in need if they’re being fussy  about what brand of whatever they’re given and stuff. (Manager, WFB) 
All Trussell Trust food banks employ a referral system in addition to a parcel limit  designed to guard against dependency ‘where it’s three vouchers in a six-month period  because we are here for a crisis only, not to be reliant on and depended upon’, as one  manager explained. Although the ‘3-in-6 rule’ may have been originally introduced to  provide short-term emergency food provision that would not undermine and potentially  replace  welfare  benefits,  another  manager  admitted  that  more  long-term  crises  were

‘increasingly common’ so that three parcels were ‘no longer sufficient’. At her discre- tion, additional parcels were given ‘on the rare occasion’ but always required having an  ‘informed  decision’  with  the  referral  agencies.  Despite  not  being  bound  by  the  same  Trussell policies, volunteers at the independent food bank insisted on the same limit of  three parcels ‘because the point is to make them independent of us, not dependent on us’.  These dominant concerns with dependency and wrong choices were closely linked to  problematisations of ‘chaotic’ lives where clients were said to lack the necessary skills,  motivation, and attitude to overcome poverty, and thus required moral guidance through  the  food  bank.  Sometimes  visiting  clients  in  their  homes  to  deliver  food  parcels,  the  manager at SFB diagnosed a culture of poverty and lack of discipline in clients said to be  ‘leading very chaotic lives’ in ‘very dirty houses’. A major problem for the manager at  WFB, too, was how to ‘deal’ with problematic clients, who, despite best intentions and  attempts by the food bank, were still ‘constantly in and out of services’. These people  remained unable to escape food poverty ‘because their lives are chaotic’ where any inter- vention by the food bank was short-lived due to a lack of personal resilience and ‘the  slightest little thing happens’ to throw them back into a state of crisis. Such targeting of  psychological deficits in wrong attitudes or decision making is characteristic of a wider  neoliberal turn to behavioural factors (Gill and Orgad, 2018), which problematises cli- ents’ subjectivities as root causes of poverty in a lack of cognitive capacity for processing  information to build necessary resilience and cope with crises. 
We’re really keen to support people out of their situation, not ingrain them into it and so having  a referral system like we do is a bit of a carrot and a stick in some ways in that we absolutely  will help you if you’re in need but it has to go hand-in-hand with you getting support from  somewhere, does that make sense? So there has to be somebody who’s looking into the bigger  picture [. . .] and foodbank is a part of that support package. (Manager, WFB) 
Through disciplinary intervention, support in the form of food provision remained  conditional and had to go ‘hand-in-hand’ with a willingness by clients to change and  constitute themselves as active welfare subjects. The pastoral care of feeding the poor is  accompanied by a disciplinary gaze in a ‘carrot and a stick’ approach to then condition  clients into demonstrating responsible conduct. The food bank becomes ‘part of that sup- port package’ in a wider pastoral network where it specialises on immediate short-term  relief but leaves any long-term intervention to other experts concerned with the ‘bigger  picture’ of personal recovery. Failure to adhere to the pastoral regime brings with it an  increasingly suspicious pastoral gaze after the third food parcel, at which point managers  would then ‘have a conversation’ as continued support becomes conditional on taking up  advice and becoming an active, self-reforming subject. What is noteworthy, and charac- teristic  of  pastoral  power  (McCuaig  et  al.,  2013)  here,  is  that  rather  than  abandoning  problematic clients, any deviancy elicits even more intense care and surveillance because  stray ‘sheep’ must not be abandoned but returned to the ‘flock’ to ensure the salvation of  each and all. 
Some exceptions were made to the parcel limit at the discretion of the manager who  would even decide over entitlements herself if clients came straight to the food bank  without a voucher from a referral agency:

If people come straight here I, I’ll often give them a food parcel if I think they’re kind of come  across as being genuine I’ll give them a food parcel or even if I’m a bit worried I’ll give them  a very small food parcel [chuckles] give them some emergency sort of food and then I’ll ask  that they get in touch with one of the other agencies really because I think if people are in need  they need more help than just the food bank can provide. (Manager, SFB) 
Again, being given a food parcel is conditional on clients presenting themselves as  ‘genuine’ in the examination of their personal crisis, while the initial feeding forms only  the first step in a treatment protocol. Even the slightest doubt might then result in ‘worry’  and incur a penalty of only getting a smaller ‘emergency’ parcel subject to seeking ‘more  help’ from affiliated partner agencies. Another volunteer explained that she would only  give out additional parcels to clients while closely monitoring their progress in ongoing  efforts  to  avoid  dependency.  To  perform  her  pastoral  duties,  she  reported  keeping  in  touch with them via text messages to develop a better knowledge of their health needs  and other ‘issues’ which are then evaluated before permission is sought from the partner  agency to give out additional parcels. In addition to providing individualised care and  guidance,  pastors  here  perform  a  double  role  (Waring  and  Latif,  2017:  4)  as  both  ‘a  “relay” of surveillance and discipline’ but also as promoters of ‘self-reflexive and self- governing subjects’ who get to define normative expectations for appropriate conduct  and enforce these in their everyday practice. 
Confessional spaces and subjectification in food banks After being welcomed and having their vouchers checked by staff, who then continue to  pack their food parcel, volunteers with specific ‘signposting’ roles invite clients to sit  down in a separate area. Small desks for individual conversations are set up in this café- style area where the client sits across from a volunteer. Clients are then offered a hot  drink, biscuits, and sometimes even a hot meal, and asked to explain their personal situ- ation. Based on these conversations, clients are signposted to partner agencies for ‘fur- ther support’. 
Then our signposters will sit down with them and have a conversation, a cup of tea with them  and a biscuit and talk to them and find out if they’re getting the help that they need umm if  they’re not getting the help that they need then we’d signpost them to an agency that can help  them. 
Pastoral power here works through signposting in confessional rituals where volun- teers take up a listening and diagnostic role of authority. As clients are waiting for their  food parcel to be packed, they are expected to verbalise their genuine need once more as  volunteers cast their pastoral gaze upon them to confirm they are receiving appropriate  care beyond material food aid. The confessional space offers a welcoming atmosphere in  a friendly encounter without any overt exercise of power in contrast to institutions like  the job centre. Signposting sessions were said to have therapeutic effects on clients, since  having expert advisors from different organisations present allowed more effective treat- ment of the ‘underlying’ problem.

Umm the majority of people will go away much more uplifted than when they came in a lot of  the time because we found that people would come in with really complex issues and we were  just referring them back out to Citizens Advice all the time. 
Signposting sessions call upon clients to avow to their crisis within a specific scene of  address (Butler, 2005) as they are asked to sit down and asked to give an account of  themselves in a situation, which creates complex power dynamics between listening giv- ers and obedient receivers. Confessions are attributed a liberating effect (Foucault, 1978:  62)  here  and  remain  inherently  individualising  but  also  relational,  since  pastors  must  extract inner truths from their ‘sheep’ to know them in their individuality, thereby further  ‘binding the individual to the spiritual director’ (Borg, 2015: 10) of the volunteer through  subordination to their authority and moral–spiritual leadership. Guided by a desire to  speak with clients directly, one manager referred to her Christian faith and the impor- tance of building ‘personal relationships’: 
I come more from the Christian background, I’m just wanting to help my neighbour making  sure that people have food and and what I have also discovered though through the years is that  it’s really the person, the personal relationships you build or the connections that you make that  can help people. (Manager, SFB) 
As  a  practising  Catholic,  her  personal  encounter  in  the  client’s  home  allowed  the  manager to diagnose the client’s needs and refer her to CAP (Christians Against Poverty)  for debt management and financial advice, thereby acting as intermediary between prob- lematic client as stray sheep and financially prudent communities. This diagnostic func- tion relies on the professional expertise of other agents where the food bank’s function is  to  identify  needs  and  establish  trust  through  personal  encounters  and  food  provision  before guiding clients onto other agencies. Through these translation practices (Waring  and  Martin,  2018),  situated  pastors  translate  discourses  of  financial  literacy,  personal  responsibility, and active citizenship into practice. By recording and disseminating these  confessions as ‘real stories’ across Trussell Trust websites and reports (Trussell Trust,  2020b), clients’ identities are further tied to their individual condition and aims for recov- ery in narratives of salvation as normative guidance for other food bank clients. Often  documenting the effects of some unexpected life event, these stories normalise expecta- tions of gratitude and moral indebtedness, while silencing any negative affect such as  resentment or anger along with any desire for social change or resistance outside the  communal care and normalisation of economic conduct overseen by the pastorate. 
Just as Foucault’s (2014) confessional subject must avow to being made in order to be  cured, ‘clients’ must embrace a new understanding of self to overcome poverty within  the offered terms of the diagnosis where signposting forms a crucial moment of subjec- tification. At the same time, speaking the truth and confessing one’s problems, or that  which is ‘most difficult to tell’ (Foucault, 1978: 59), promises understanding and recog- nition by others in a safe space. Confessions are then always produced relationally – that  is, through power itself – where ‘we are compelled and internalize the compulsion, to  search out and bring into light of day the truth of our selves, but in the process we create  these truths, and create selves as products of power’ (Taylor, 2009: 78). It is through

these confessional rituals that clients are produced as subjects of charity and expected to  bind, and therefore limit themselves to a new understanding of self as requiring treatment  for an underlying condition located within the self which requires expert diagnosis and  medical intervention. 
Signs of resistance Repeatedly pointing out fractures and contingencies in the histories of confessional prac- tices, Foucault points out the political dimensions of refusal and reinvention by becom- ing  other  than  what  we  are,  rather  than  binding  ourselves  to  offered  identities  by  confessing what we are (Taylor, 2009). The constant need for verbalisation of referral  reasons as inner truths and avowing to these ‘underlying reasons’ was indeed shown to  be part of a larger expert culture that exercises power while silencing alternative solu- tions beyond food charity. Yet, the manager at SFB reported that some clients resisted her  attempts at building a personal relationship by rushing the exchange of the food parcel  and not allowing her into their home, thereby successfully evading her pastoral gaze.  This indicates some capacity for resistance among the flock (Martin and Waring, 2018)  with pastors relying on the recognition of their legitimacy and willingness by subjects  offering  to  speak  of  their  problems  and  constitute  themselves  as  obedient  subjects  of  charity. 
Whereas  SFB  and  EFB  had  embraced  further  expansion  and  building  closer  links  with businesses and local authorities, the manager at WFB reflected much more critically  on their further institutionalisation and had refused to accept referrals by the local job  centre. She was equally critical of the local council who had underspent hardship funds  1 year and instead sent over 600 families to the food bank, thereby breaking their ‘statu- tory duty of care’. As a ‘subject of doubt’ (Clarke et al., 2007: 141), she is capable of  reflecting  on  –  and  then  rejecting  the  governmental  transfer  of  further  responsibility.  While the food bank managers in this study frequently pointed to structural drivers of  food bank use in benefit cuts and delays, not all were comfortable with this advocacy role  and one manager refused to answer any questions related to government policy because  she was ‘not supposed to be political’. In contrast, the manager at the independent food  bank reported having regular political discussions and disagreements with her volunteers  and despite not attributing blame, she argued, ‘the government can do more’. This shows  how managers can themselves be placed in a restrictive subject position through institu- tional discourses and constructions of charity as unpolitical. There has been a consider- able shift in the public relations strategy by the Trussell Trust from proudly aiming to  build  a  food  bank  in  every  town  at  the  height  of  their  expansion  (Lambie-Mumford,  2013) to today’s declared mission as ‘anti-poverty’ charity doing considerable media and  advocacy work to scandalise the extent and drivers of food bank use in the UK. However,  it is also through these policy critiques and published usage figures that food banks posi- tion themselves as emergency responders, merely reacting to existing needs and filling  gaps in provision, seemingly outside of political power and opposed to a retreating wel- fare  state. A  governmentality  perspective  challenges  this  easy  distinction  and  instead  ‘focuses  on  technologies  that  are  materialized  and  stabilized  in  institutional  settings’  (Lemke, 2007: 50), including charities.

To analyse the government of poverty as a social problem then means to analyse the  wider  ‘discursive  field  within  which  these  problems,  sites  and  forms  of  visibility  are  delineated  and  accorded  significance’  (Rose  and  Miller,  2010:  275),  which  cannot  exclude food banks themselves. While they may not be mere ‘dupes of neoliberal gov- ernmentality’ (Williams et al., 2014: 2807) given how they retain a degree of institutional  agency  with  considerable  variability  and  competing  problematisations  between  sites,  they become centres of calculation and action (Rose, 2006), providing crucial material  infrastructures with access and new opportunities to monitor risks and regulate the well- being of the ‘flock’ (McCuaig et al., 2013). As seen in the examples above, this does not  render resistance impossible and pastoral power as analytic lens affords a more active  role in negotiating available discourses and translating them into situated practices. It is  here that errors in translation (Rose and Miller, 2010) frequently occur and opportunities  for subversion may open up. Rather than idealising resistance across any such ‘intersti- tial spaces of resistance’ (Williams et al., 2014: 2810) as distinctly ‘other’ spaces of care,  we should pay close attention to how they may also minimise resistance by coordinating  better alignment with discourses of employability, productivity, and discipline. 
Discussion Shepherding a hungry flock Across the three food banks in this study, pastoral practices constantly balanced disci- pline and subjectification ‘which together categorise, inscribe, normalise and monitor  desirable subjectivities’ (Waring and Latif, 2017: 15) in a pastoral network of organisa- tions  whose  expertise  and  authority  have  remained  largely  uncontested.  The  pastoral  labour by volunteers in communal spaces was accompanied by disciplinary normalisa- tion of clients’ financial and moral conduct, driven by discourses of welfare conditional- ity, material dependency, and individual crises requiring expert intervention and skills  training.  Ethnographic  studies  have  raised  other  concerns  over  a  ‘dark  side’  of  food  banking  pointing  to  the  stigmatising  effects  of  food  aid  and  experiences  of  shame  (Garthwaite, 2016; Van Der Horst et al., 2014). May et al. (2019b) further point to how  the bureaucratic system, located mainly in the voucher system, together with construc- tions of scarcity by the Trussell Trust, reinforces divisions between ‘worthy’ and ‘unwor- thy’ recipients. Yet, despite identifying some overlaps between food bank practices and  neoliberal  discourses,  Cloke  et  al.  (2017)  emphasise  their  transformative  potential  as  ‘caring places’ in normative terms without recognising the power inherent to this pasto- ral care. 
In  contrast, Waring  and  Martin’s  (2018:  138)  extended  conception  of  pastoral  net- works has shown these to be ‘crucial nodes in neoliberalism who translate prevailing  mentalities or discourses into specific life worlds’ while also ‘deflecting resistance and  maximising alignment between neoliberal discourse and the values and self-identity of  the community’, especially in times of crisis. This could be seen in the ways managers  and volunteers sought to reintegrate food bank clients into the community, while promot- ing  dominant  norms  of  personal  responsibility  and  economic  independence. Whereas  Foucault (2009b: 143) described a history of the Christian pastorate where ‘there are

never several shepherds for a flock; there is only one’ who issues lifelong and consistent  guidance, Waring  and  Latif  (2017:  12)  have  convincingly  demonstrated  how  modern  regimes of governmentality work through networks of multiple pastors and pastorates  potentially in competition with one another. With possibly conflicting interests and oper- ating in different social spaces, these pastors are capable of developing different relation- ships  with  subjects  and  complement  another’s  expertise,  as  seen  with  the  growing  networks between food banks and advice agencies. These partnerships then present a  possible fragmentation of surveillance where no single actor or institution seeks to hold  complete  knowledge  of  their  clients  but  operates  only  within  the  frame  of  their  own  expertise  and  local  reach. After  all,  ‘such  preeminent  power  of  sight  belongs  to  God  alone’ (Siisiäinen, 2015: 241) and no human pastor can ‘ever achieve an all-seeing sur- veillance and knowledge’ of their flock. There is clearly a dilemma here for the food  bank which does not have the necessary resources nor expertise to offer exclusive care  for long-term needs and must instead refer clients to other expert services, at least tem- porarily entrusting their ‘flock’ to another shepherd. 
Another  relevant  element  to  pastoral  power  is  ‘sacrificial  reversal’  (Foucault,  2009c:  170) through which pastors must be willing to make physical and spiritual sacrifices in ser- vice of their flock. Here it must be noted that volunteers are themselves guided and subjecti- fied by dominant discourses which impose limits on their capacity to act and think outside  the boundaries of neoliberal government. This paradoxical position raises the question of the  costs to volunteers who sacrifice themselves for their flock of clients by investing consider- able time and their unpaid labour while risking their health to maintain food charities during  the COVID-19 crisis (Power et al., 2020). Although the impact of social distancing meas- ures and closure of churches on interactions and power dynamics in food bank spaces is not  known at this point, some independent food banks like SFB have long maintained their  pastoral networks through delivery schemes and partnerships with other agencies. 
The medicalisation of poverty Much of the existing literature on food poverty in Western countries recognises how aus- terity  policies  have  transferred  responsibilities  from  state  welfare  onto  charitable  food  providers, absolving governments from political responsibility and even de-politicising  poverty itself (Caraher and Furey, 2018; Riches, 2018). However, contrary to dominant  understandings  of  food  charities  merely  responding  to  state  retreat  and  filling  gaps  in  provision (see Lambie-Mumford, 2018), governmentality scholars have long insisted that  neoliberalisation as a social process does not mean less government but government at a  distance (Rose, 2001b). Historically, neoliberal strategies for managing poverty have been  guided by discourses of empowerment and self-help (Cruikshank, 1999), risk assessment  (Dean, 2010), and instilling responsibility by targeting skills deficits using community  both as a site and technology of government (Rose, 2001a). A common dilemma here is  the reluctance to act through direct coercion, as neoliberal governmentality seeks to mini- mise direct intervention (Binkley, 2018) in favour of more distanced manipulations and  constructions of market environments built upon the principle of not governing too much.  Analysis of signposting practices has indeed shown how the pastoral desire to know cli- ents and guide their moral conduct was accompanied by careful and subtle nudging, at

least until the parcel limit had first been reached. Rather than coercing clients through  overt exercise of power, such paternalistic libertarianism (Jones et al., 2011) retains disci- plinary mechanisms but prefers to act upon people’s capacity to exercise through their  own freedom in the pursuit of better economic outcomes. 
For McFalls and Pandolfi (2014: 173), neoliberalism is further characterised by ‘a  therapeutic mode of government, one that legitimates its authority with claims of benev- olence,  of  expertise,  and  even  of  empowerment  of  those  whose  conduct  it  guides’.  Therapeutic discourses of crisis, prevention, early intervention, and recovery were evi- dent across food bank practices where they medicalise poverty as an individual condition  amenable to diagnosis and expert intervention. Medicalisation is here understood as a  social and historical process (Clarke et al., 2003; Conrad, 2007), which extends medical  jurisdiction, technologies, institutional reach, and expert knowledge into new areas of  social life, thereby transforming social problems into treatable conditions at the level of  subjectivity. Here, a pastor takes up a key role in translating medical intervention, as  ‘essentially a doctor who has to take responsibility for each soul and for the sickness of  each soul’ (Foucault, 2009c: 174) tasked with diagnosing faults and deviant subjectivi- ties. Pastoral power is so persistent because it combines disciplinary intervention with  the promise of salvation through benevolent care. The signposting of food bank clients  to  welfare  advice  services  can  undoubtedly  have  very  positive  effects  in  maximising  benefit  entitlements  and  could  even  be  seen  as  a  way  of  resisting  a  punitive  welfare  regime. However, such support still relies on the unquestionable expertise and authority  of pastors (Waring and Latif, 2017) who not only monitor and discipline but also ‘nurture  self-governing subjectivities’ so people can equip themselves with the skills and knowl- edge necessary to conform to the market and survive the shocks of austerity yet to come.  Becoming an active consumer of advice services, financial literacy, and cooking courses  in our fully therapeutic present (McFalls and Pandolfi, 2014) may offer some immediate  relief but always comes at a cost as it reduces political questions to the technical manage- ment of a life in constant crisis. 
Conclusion This study set out to address the lack of critical engagement with power relationships  inside food banks and challenge essentialist concerns with cause and effect, which reduce  them to necessary, but shameful, responses to a retreating state as natural expression of  community. In welcoming spaces of care and support, the provision of food parcels and  other support were shown as forms of pastoral labour (Butler, 2019) accompanied also  by disciplinary acts of monitoring clients’ conduct, limiting their entitlements, and mak- ing  them  conditional  in  a  wider  pastoral  network,  which  medicalises  social  problems  (Conrad, 2007) and denies any agency in intervening in them. Far from either condemn- ing or idealising the sacrificial labour inside food banks, the purpose of this article was  to make visible these ‘dividing practices’ (Foucault, 2002b) and to cultivate reflexive  doubt among volunteers and the public so that thinking outside the normality of food  charity becomes possible. This raises new questions and ethical issues for critical soci- ologists, including the extent to which we may be critical of charity and volunteer work.  The non-normative critique (Hansen, 2014) I am advocating is not directed at volunteers

or charities but at the discourses and unquestioned truths, which guide their conduct.  Opening  such  a  space  for  critique  requires  ‘analysing  and  reflecting  upon  limits’  (Foucault, 2000: 315) imposed on our reality and deciding what ways of acting, thinking,  and feeling about poverty should no longer be acceptable so we can re-politicise and de- essentialise  charitable  solutions.  Read  as  an  ‘essay  in  refusal’  and  ‘an  instrument  for  those who fight, those who resist and refuse what is’ (Foucault, 2002a: 236), this article  contributes to a critical ontology of ourselves as ongoing political work capable of resist- ing simple solutions claiming to be outside of power and critique, in favour of histori- cally  sensitive  and  empirically  grounded  analyses  of  what  is  at  stake  in  becoming  neoliberal subjects. Such critical ethos does not stop with saying that food banks should  not exist but resists causal reductionism by continuing to ask how they have come to  exist in their current form, and what their own discursive practices and rituals mean for  the constitution of subjects of charity. 
Despite  offering  new  insights  into  these  neglected  power  dynamics  and  discursive  dynamics at three UK food banks, there are clear limitations to the study and throughout  I  have  emphasised  the  importance  of  local  knowledges  and  ways  that  discourses  are  translated into situated practices. Given the focus on institutional discourses and local  power effects, the findings do not reflect the diverse values, perspectives, and political  attitudes of those volunteering at food banks (Williams et al., 2016). Especially among  independent  food  banks,  there  is  considerable  variability  in  operating  procedures  and  40% of independent food banks in England (Loopstra et al., 2019a) do not employ a  referral  system  and  may  offer  more  long-term  provision.  However,  despite  varying  degrees of autonomy, all the 1200 food bank centres operating under the Trussell Trust  are bound by the referral system and parcel limits where exceptions remain discretionary  and  conditional  on  the  uptake  of  other  support  as  a  tool  for  behavioural  activation.  Coinciding with record needs and the integration of food charities into the COVID-19  response by the UK government, food banks have already widely reported food short- ages and declining donations. Given these pressures arising from sustained economic  and deep structural crises in capitalism, it seems likely that debates over deservingness  are set to continue, but food banks are themselves deeply ingrained in these politics of  knowledge production. Decisions over entitlements to a food voucher are routinely out- sourced  to  partner  agencies  as  a  form  of  moral  distancing  and  rationing  (Beck  and  Gwilym,  2020;  May  et  al.,  2019b),  but  within  these  pastoral  networks,  responsibility  becomes further fragmented and ‘genuine’ poverty must constantly be performed. The  expansion  and  institutionalisation  of  food  charity  then  cannot  be  understood  without  critical analysis of the discursive reproduction of poverty in medical terms and the (self-) examination of inner truths to which people bind themselves in times of crisis. This rec- ognition not only opens new possibilities for resisting medicalisation but also calls for  more critical reflexivity in poverty research, including its own power effects and role in  an expanding therapeutic regime.
